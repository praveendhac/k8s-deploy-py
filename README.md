# k8s-deploy-py
Kubernetes deployment using k8s Python API

## Problem
Use Kubernetes library for Python to deploy and check a basic application (of our choice) onto a Kubernetes cluster (we can use Minikube or a cloud service for testing/demoing). 
This application should deploy at least a pod/deployment and a configMap/secret.
